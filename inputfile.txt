Acknowledgment
We express our sincere gratitude for the invaluable guidance and technical insights provided by
our academic mentor Dr. Sneha Sudhakaran, whose expertise significantly enhanced our
understanding of complex web development concepts. As a team of four students (Mr. Rusheel
Raj Pannakadan, Mr. Sandesh More, Mr. Max Zhou and Miss. Prajakta Meher), this
academic project presented us with numerous challenges, each met with a collective dedication
to innovation and problem-solving. Our professors' support was instrumental in helping us
navigate through intricate aspects of Python Flask, web security, and database management,
enriching our practical skills and theoretical knowledge. We also extend our heartfelt thanks to
our families and friends, whose unwavering support and encouragement were vital in
maintaining our morale and focus. This project, a confluence of technical rigor and collaborative
effort, has been a transformative experience, underscoring the importance of resilience and
teamwork in achieving our academic and technical goals.
ABSTRACT
In the Supermarket project, as a team, we embarked on developing a sophisticated e-commerce
web application as part of an academic endeavor. Utilizing the Python Flask framework, this
project aimed to create an intuitive, secure, and efficient online shopping platform. The
application integrates front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a
Flask-powered backend, highlighting a harmonious blend of user interface design and server-side
functionality. Special focus was given to addressing web security concerns and implementing
measures against SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks. The use of SQLite for database management underlines the project's commitment to
lightweight yet robust data handling. This project not only showcases the practical application of
comprehensive web development skills but also reflects the collaborative spirit and technical
prowess of the team in navigating the complexities of creating a secure and user-friendly
e-commerce environment.
